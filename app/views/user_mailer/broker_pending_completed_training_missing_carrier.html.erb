Dear <%=applicant_name%>,
<br/><br/>
Thank you for submitting an application to DC Health Link to become an approved broker. 
We show you have completed the necessary training through NAHU, but you are still missing carrier appointments with 
<%unchecked_carriers.each do |k,v| %>
	<li><%=k.humanize.titleize%></li>
<%end%>
. You can verify your carrier appointments here by searching by your name or NPN and clicking on your name. 
Please also review our broker registration guide for the full list of required carriers: https://dchealthlink.com/sites/default/files/v2/forms/new_broker_registration.pdf
